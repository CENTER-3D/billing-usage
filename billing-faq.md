## What is a GB-hour?
{: #gb-hour}
{: faq}

Runtime and container usage is charged based on the following variables:
 • How much memory your runtime or container uses, in gigabytes (GB)
 • The duration that memory is used

Multiply the two values together, and the result is the GB-hour.

## How many apps can I build?
{: #howmanyapps}
{: faq}

In a Lite account, your apps have up to 256 MB of instantaneous runtime memory. You can deploy apps until you use the available Lite account allowance. If you need more memory, upgrade to a billable account to get 512 MB of free instantaneous runtime memory and pay only for what you use over that limit. There's no limit to the number of apps you can build in a billable account.


## What happens if my Lite plan instance reaches the monthly quota?
{: #monthlyquota}
