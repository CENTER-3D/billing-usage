{: #contactsupport}
{: faq}

Click **Support** in the console menu bar to access the Support Center. From there, start with leveraging the list of common FAQs. If you don't find the answers that you need, see the **Need more help?** section to contact IBM Cloud support.

## What is a GB-hour?
{: #gb-hour}
{: faq}

Runtime and container usage is charged based on the following variables:
 • How much memory your runtime or container uses, in gigabytes (GB)
 • The duration that memory is used

Multiply the two values together, and the result is the GB-hour.

## How many apps can I build?
{: #howmanyapps}
{: faq}

In a Lite account, your apps have up to 256 MB of instantaneous runtime memory. You can deploy apps until you use the available Lite account allowance. If you need more memory, upgrade to a billable account to get 512 MB of free instantaneous runtime memory and pay only for what you use over that limit. There's no limit to the number of apps you can build in a billable account.


## What happens if my Lite plan instance reaches the monthly quota?
{: #monthlyquota}
{: faq}

When you reach any quota limit for Lite plan instances, the service for that month is suspended. Quota limits are per org and not per instance. New instances that are created in the same org show any usage from previous instances. The quota limits reset on the first of every month.


## What can I order with my Subscription account?
{: #subs-order}
{: faq}

You can order platform and infrastructure offerings from the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog.


## How do I qualify for a discount on a Subscription account?
{: #subs-discount}
{: faq}

To qualify for a pricing discount, you must commit to a combined minimum spending and term commitment of $100.00 USD each month for 12 months.


## Is there a monthly minimum amount required for Subscription accounts?
{: #subs-minimum}
{: faq}

Yes, you must spend a minimum of $100.00 USD each month.

## How do I add subscription credit to my account?
{: #subscriptioncode}
{: faq}

After you purchase a subscription, you'll receive an email with a subscription code that adds the credit to your account. To apply the subscription code, go to [Account settings](https://{DomainName}/account/settings), and click **Apply code**. For more information, see [Managing subscriptions](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-subscriptions).

## What am I charged if I go over the total amount of my Subscription?
{: #subs-overage}
{: faq}

You're charged the non-discounted rate for any usage that goes over your total Subscription amount.


## Can I pay the total spending commitment up-front or quarterly?
{: #subs-pay-schedule}
{: faq}

Currently, you can make monthly payments to your Subscription account. If you'd like to pay up-front or quarterly, contact [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Sales](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/contact-us){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg).


## Can I spend more or less than my monthly commitment?  
{: #subs-spending}
{: faq}

Yes, what you spend monthly is up to you! You can spend any amount of the total commitment each month.


## Can I cancel my Subscription account before the end of my term commitment?  
{: #subs-cancel-early}
{: faq}

A subscription is a contract between you and IBM that commits you to use {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} for a specific term and spending amount. You can request to cancel your subscription before the end of the term, but whether the subscription can be canceled is at the discretion of IBM. Any remaining credit on your subscription might be forfeited. To inquire about this possibility, contact support. Make sure that you provide details about why you need to cancel your subscription.


## What happens if I reach my spending commitment before my term ends?  
{: #subs-spend-before-term-end}
{: faq}

You're required to continue paying your monthly charges until the end of your term. To avoid generating overage charges, contact [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Sales](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/contact-us){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg) for help with signing up for a new subscription.

## How can I monitor spending?
{: #monitor-spending}
{: faq}
You can view your monthly runtime and service usage by clicking **Manage > Billing and usage > Usage**. Learn more in [Viewing your usage](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-viewingusage).

## Can I receive notifications when my spending reaches specific levels?
{: #spending-notify}
{: faq}

You can set separate spending thresholds for the account, container, runtime, all services, and specific services. You automatically receive notifications when your monthly spending reaches 80%, 90%, and 100% of those thresholds. To set spending notifications, click **Manage > Billing and usage** and select **Spending notifications**. For more information, see [Setting spending notifications](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-spending).

## Where can I access my invoice?
{: #access-invoices}
{: faq}

If you have a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account, you can view your invoice by clicking **Manage > Billing and usage**, and selecting **Invoices**. Outside of the console, you can also view invoices on the [Customer Support Invoices site](https://www.ibm.com/invoices){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg).

Lite accounts don't have invoices because you're never charged for Lite plan usage.

## Why does my usage not match my invoice?
{: #usage-not-match-invoice}
{: faq}

Your usage might not match your invoice because the months that are used to compare usage aren't the same, or the total amount of the orgs wasn't selected. For more information, see [Viewing your usage](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-viewingusage). If it still doesn't match, get in touch with us by calling 1-866-325-0045 and choosing the third option, or by opening a [support case](https://{DomainName}/unifiedsupport/supportcenter){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg).

## Does the price of the offering that I'm ordering reflect the discounted price?
{: #discount-price}
{: faq}

Yes, if your account includes any discounts, the price of the offering that is displayed in your infrastructure order summary does reflect the discounted price of that offering.

## Why can't I manage my invoices?
{: #slperm-manage-invoices}
{: faq}

The SoftLayer permission for managing invoices might not have been migrated correctly in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. Ask your account owner to add you to the View account summary access group. For more information, see [Managing migrated SoftLayer account permissions](/docs/iam?topic=iam-migrated_permissions).

## How do I confirm that I received an expected credit?
{: #receive-credit}
{: faq}

Credit might take a few hours to appear in your account.  To see whether a credit was added, go to **Manage > Billing and usage**, and select **Usage**. The credit might be listed in the Active subscriptions and credits section.

If the credit isn't on the Usage page, go to **Invoices** and click link with the date for your next recurring invoice. If you don't see the credit on the next recurring invoice, it is not yet added to your account. Check back later to verify that you received the credit.
