# FAQs
{: #billusagefaqs} 

## How many apps can I build?
{: #howmanyapps}

In a Lite account your apps can access up to 256 MB of instantaneous runtime memory. You can deploy apps until you have used the available Lite account allowance. If you need additional memory, upgrade to a billable account to get 512 MB of free instantaneous runtime memory and pay only for what you use past that. There are no limits to the number of apps you can build in a billable account.
