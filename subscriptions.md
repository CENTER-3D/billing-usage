# Managing subscriptions
{: #subscriptions}

With an {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} subscription, you get discounted usage for platform and infrastructure services and support by committing to a minimum spending commitment and term. You can purchase your first subscription, apply additional platform or support subscription credits, and monitor subscription usage on the Subscriptions page in the console.
{: shortdesc}

If you purchase a subscription, your account is converted to a Subscription account type. Learn more about other benefits of Subscription accounts in [Account types](/docs/account?topic=account-accounts).
{: tip}

## Viewing subscription usage
{: #subscription-usage}

You can view the subscriptions in your account to track your credit spending. To access this information, you need the Viewer or higher role on the Billing service in the account.

To view your subscription usage, go to **Manage > Billing and usage**, and select **Subscriptions**.

  * Click the tabs to view spending details and trends about your subscription usage, including any usage overages that your account incurred. For example, the credit burndown view displays how your credit balance has changed over time, and the spending by month view displays your monthly spending from all subscriptions.
  * View all active and inactive subscriptions in your account in the tables. If a subscription spans more than a year, it's divided into multiple terms up to one year each. Active subscriptions are subscriptions that still have remaining credit to spend and time left in the subscription term. Upcoming subscriptions are subscriptions were added to the account but have not yet reached their term period. A subscription is inactive if its term expires or all of its credit is spent.

You can use the spending and usage information on the Subscriptions page to evaluate whether your subscriptions suit your usage needs. For example, if you consistently have overages, you might increase your monthly spending commitment to save money on that usage. To purchase new subscriptions or change future subscription amounts, contact [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Sales](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/contact-us){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg).

## Adding subscription credit
{: #subscription-codes}

After you purchase a subscription for platform or support credit, you add the credit to your account by applying a subscription code. Applying the code ensures that the credit is added to your account and you don't have unexpected overage charges.

If you set up your first subscription through the Subscriptions page, the credit for this subscription is automatically added to your account - no code required.
{: tip}

After {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Sales places the order, an email with the subscription code for each subscription and support line item is sent to the appropriate contact. If you purchased a subscription and didn't receive your subscription code, [contact us ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/contact-us){: new_window} or email Sales at CloudDigitalSales@us.ibm.com to request for it to be sent again.

Only the account owner or a user with the Editor or Administrator role on the Billing service can apply the subscription code. If you don't have access to apply subscription codes, the account owner or administrator can provide access. See [Assigning access to account management services](/docs/iam?topic=iam-account-services) for more information.

1. From the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console, go to **Manage > Account**, and select **Account settings**.
1. Click **Apply code**.

  Each code can be redeemed only once before the code's expiration date. Credit that is added to an account cannot be removed.
  {: important}

1. Enter the subscription code, and click **Apply**.

   If you have separate codes for platform and support credit, apply the platform subscription code first, then apply the support subscription code.

If you don't know your seller, the codes are applied in the wrong order, or you experience issues with applying the codes, [contact {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Support](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-getting-customer-support).
