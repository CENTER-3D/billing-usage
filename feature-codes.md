# Applying feature (promo) codes
{: #codes}

Feature codes offer you extra resources or capabilities for your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} account.  
{: shortdesc}

The extra resources or capabilities that are provided vary depending on the particular code, but include one or more of the following items in general:

  * Increase the memory quota to a number of GB specified by the code
  * Add one organization with a memory quota that is specified by the code
  * Add an unlimited number of organizations
  * Upload an extra number of SSL certificates, as specified by the code
  * Use premium service plans
  * Add subscription and support entitlement credits to linked Pay-As-You-Go and linked Subscription accounts

For linked Pay-As-You-Go and linked Subscription accounts, feature codes are required to add subscription and support entitlement credits. After {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} Sales places an order, an email for each subscription and support line item is sent to the quote contact, the provisioning contact, or both. Feature codes must be applied only by the account owner to provision the order. The account owner must apply the subscription feature code to the account before applying the support code.

  * If you didn't receive your feature code, [contact us ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/contact-us){: new_window} or email Sales at CloudDigitalSales@us.ibm.com to request for it to be sent again.
  * If you don't know your seller, the codes are applied in the wrong order, or you experience issues with applying the codes, [contact Support](/docs/get-support/howtogetsupport.html). 

Applying the feature codes ensures that the entitlement credits are added to your account and you don't incur additional overage charges.
{: tip}

Complete the following steps to apply a code:

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console, go to **Manage > Billing and Usage > Billing**.
2. Enter the feature code details and click **Apply code**. If you have a linked Pay-As-You-Go or linked Subscription account, remember to apply the subscription code before the support code.

Each code can be redeemed only once before the code's expiration date. Entitlement is added to the account of the IBMid user who applies the codes.
