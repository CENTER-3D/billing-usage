# Applying feature (promo) codes
{: #codes}

Sometimes {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} Sales or other representatives provide feature codes, previously known as promo codes, to offer you extra resources or capabilities for your Lite or trial account.
{: shortdesc}

The extra resources or capabilities that are provided by {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} vary depending on the particular code, but include one or more of the following items in general:

  * Increase the memory quota to a number of GB specified by the code
  * Add one organization, with a memory quota that is specified by the code
  * Add an unlimited number of organizations
  * Upload an extra number of SSL certificates, as specified by the code
  * Use premium service plans

Complete the following steps to apply a code:

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console, go to **Manage > Billing and Usage > Billing**.
2. Enter the feature code details and click **Apply code**.

Each code can be redeemed only once before the code's expiration date.
