# Applying promo codes
{: #applying-promo-codes}

Promotions are limited-time credits toward your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} account and services that you can get by applying promo codes. Each promo code can be used once and is valid only for a certain amount of time. Promo codes are provided on a limited basis by {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} sales to customers with billable accounts. 
{:shortdesc} 

Promo codes are typically based on short phrases, like `PROMO200`. If you have an alphanumeric code, such as `a1b2c3def456`, it's a different type of code that is referred to as a feature code. You can apply these codes to Lite accounts on the **Manage > Accounts > Account settings** page. For more information, see [Applying feature codes to Lite accounts](/docs/account?topic=account-codes).

## Applying promo codes to your account
{: #apply-promo-billing}

You can apply promo codes to Pay-As-You-Go and Subscription accounts. Any user in the account has access to view and apply promo codes. You can have any number of promo codes that are applied to your account and services at a time. You can use each promo code only once, and you can't remove them after you apply them.  

Promo codes can't be applied to hierarchial modal accounts or IBM Cloud Enterprises.
{: note}

Complete the following steps to apply promo codes to your account and services:  

  1. From the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console, click **Manage** > **Billing and usage**, and select **Promotions**. 
  1. Enter your promo code, and click **Apply**.

Existing classic infrastructure promo codes can be applied only through the catalog when you create those classic infrastructure services. To apply these promo codes, you must have one of the following classic infrastructure permissions on the account: add or upgrade storage, add or upgrade services, or add server.
