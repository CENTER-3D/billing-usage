# Setting spending notifications
{: #spending}
{: help} 
{: support}

If you have an {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account, you can set up email spending notifications. Now, in addition to account owners, any user on the account with the editor role or higher on the billing service can set spending notifications. You can enable spending notifications for total account, runtime, container, and service spending, or add spending for individual services, including third-party services. 
{: shortdesc}

You receive notifications when you reach 80%, 90%, and 100% of the spending thresholds that you specify. As your needs change, you can edit the spending threshold. If you're interested, you can use the latest enhancement to select up to 10 users from your account to receive notifications about the service. 

Lite accounts can't enable spending notifications because they can use only no-cost Lite services, so you never have any spending. After you upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account, you can set spending thresholds. For more information, see [Account types](/docs/account?topic=account-accounts).
