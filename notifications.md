# Setting spending notifications
{: #spending}

If you are a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account owner, you can set up email spending notifications. Set notifications for total account, runtime, container, and service spending, or spending for individual services, excluding third-party services.
{: shortdesc}

You receive notifications when you reach 80%, 90%, and 100% of the spending thresholds that you specify. You can edit each spending notification at any time as your needs change.

If you have a Lite account, you can upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account to set spending limits. For more information, see [Account types](/docs/account?topic=account-accounts).

To set up your notifications:

1. From the console, go to **Manage > Billing and usage**, and select **Spending notifications**.
2. Set the dollar amount for each area you would like to receive a notification.
3. Make sure to check the box in the email column for that specific area.

You can also set email spending notifications for specific services.

1. From the console, go to **Manage > Billing and usage**, and select **Spending notifications**.
2. Expand the `Add a service` menu, select a service, and set the dollar amount for each area you would like to receive a notification.
3. When you are finished, click **Save** to save your changes.

Spending for third-party services is not included in the notifications.
