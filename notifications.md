# Setting spending notifications
{: #spending}

If you are an {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account owner, you can set up email spending notifications. Set notifications for total account, runtime, container, and service spending, or spending for individual services, excluding third-party services.
{: shortdesc}

You receive notifications when you reach 80%, 90%, and 100% of the spending thresholds that you specify. You can edit each spending notification at any time as your needs change.

Lite accounts can't enable spending notifications because they can use only no-cost Lite services, so you never have any spending. After you upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account, you can set spending thresholds. For more information, see [Account types](/docs/account?topic=account-accounts).

To set up your notifications:

1. From the console, go to **Manage > Billing and usage**, and select **Spending notifications**.
2. Set the dollar amount for each area you would like to receive a notification.
3. Make sure to select the checkbox in the email column for that specific area.

You can also set email spending notifications for specific services.

1. From the console, go to **Manage > Billing and usage**, and select **Spending notifications**.
2. Expand the **Add a service** menu, select a service, and set the dollar amount for each area you would like to receive a notification.
3. When you are finished, click **Save** to save your changes.

Spending for third-party services is not included in the notifications.
