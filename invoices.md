# Managing your invoices 
{: #viewing-invoices}

To manage and view your invoices, you can use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} billing and usage dashboard. If your account is billed through a separate billing platform, you can use IBM Invoices.

## Viewing your invoices 
{: #viewing-invoices}

To view your invoice for a Pay-As-You-Go account that's billed by using US dollars, go to **Manage** > **Billing and usage**, and select **Invoices**. 

## Viewing your invoices outside of the console
{: #viewing-external-invoices}

If you have a Pay-As-You-Go account that is billed in a currency other than US dollars or a Subscription account, you view your invoices on the [IBM Invoices](http://ibm.com/invoices){: external} website that's linked from the Invoices page in the console.

If you're visiting the Invoices website for the first time you can sign up with your IBMid and complete your profile, then add access to your account with your IBM customer number. An IBM customer number identifies IBM customers during registration and during other interactions with IBM Support.

1. Go to [IBM Invoices](http://ibm.com/invoices){: external}, and select your region.
1. Log in with the same IBMid and password that you use to log in to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. 
1. Complete your profile on the Invoices website. 
1. From the Invoices website, go to the **Accesses** tab. Add access to your account and provide your IBM customer number. If you don't know your customer number, contact IBM Cloud Support through [live chat](https://{DomainName}/unifiedsupport/supportcenter) or by calling 1-866-325-0045 and selecting the third option. 

To access your invoices in the future, you can click the link from the Invoices page in the console or bookmark the external invoices website to go to it directly.
