## Unable to access billing information
{: #cannot-access-billing-info}

### What's happening

When you try to access your billing information, you get an error message stating that you aren't authorized to view the billing information for the account.

### Why it's happening

You must be an account owner or a billing manager for an organization. 

### How to fix it

Check your access role by completing the following steps: 

1. Go to **Manage** > **Security** > **Identity and access**, and click **Users**.
2. Click your name from the Users list.
3. In the **Access policies** section, you can view your assigned access policies. 
4. In the **Role** column, check to see whether you have an account owner or billing manager role.  

If you don't have the necessary role, contact your account owner to get your role changed to view your billing information.
