# Managing payments
{: #linkedusage}

You can use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} billing and usage dashboard to make a one-time payment, change your credit card details, view your billing items, and view your invoices.

To manage payments, you need an access policy with the Operator role or higher on the Billing account management service. See [IAM access](/docs/iam?topic=iam-userroles) for more information.

## Making a one-time payment
{: #makepayment}

You can make a one-time payment at any time, for any amount, whether it is for the full balance or a partial sum. The details that you enter for the one-time payment aren't recorded for future use, and aren't filled out with a defaulted amount. Payment methods for one-time payments include credit card and PayPal. 

To make a one-time payment, go to **Manage > Billing and usage**, and select **Payments**. Complete the fields in the make a one-time payment section. The account balance is updated after the payment is accepted.


## Changing your payment method
{: #changepaymethod}

Each billable account must have a valid credit card or PayPal account. Every month, the credit card is charged with the usage amount that is accumulated during that month. To add or change your payment details, go to **Manage > Billing and usage**, and select **Payments**. Then, click **Payment method**.

When your payment details are validated, they are available to use in your account within 24 hours. A confirmation email is sent to the contact entered in the card billing address section.
